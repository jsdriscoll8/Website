                <h2>What is nuclear energy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Nuclear energy is the process by which the energy from nuclear
                    fission is used to generate electiricity. Rods of radioactive material
                    are immersed in water, which acts to cool them off. Once this water is heated,
                    its steam is used to spin a turbine.

                <h2>The Benefits of Nuclear Energy</h2>
                <p>
                    Much like other modes of green energy, nuclear energy
                    emits negligiable carbon and other greenhouse gases, relying
                    exclusively on radioactivity and water. Additonally, nuclear generation
                    is energy-dense: a single reactor may produce over a gigawatt of power -
                    more than over 3 million 320-watt solar panels.

                <h2>The Drawbacks of Nuclear Energy</h2>
                <p>
                    The foremost drawback of nuclear energy is its
                    reputation. The Chernobyl disaster, especially, greatly reduced the public
                    faith in the technology. Even though the Chernobyl plant was poorly designed,
                    staffed, and maintained, fears that something similar could once again happen
                    yet exist. Additionally, the initial building expenses of nuclear reactors
                    are quite high, and determing what to do with nuclear waste will always be
                    contentious.
