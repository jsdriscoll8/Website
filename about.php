                <h2>What is Green Energy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Green energy broadly refers to renewable energy sources not reliant on fossil fuel extraction.
                    Types include solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and nuclear. Green energy has presented itself
                    as an affordable and less environmentally damaging alternative to traditional energy sources.

                <h2>Why green energy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Green energy is good for the planet and good for people. Green energy methods
                    emit little to no greenhouse gases when compared to traditional fossil fuel energy sources. 
                    Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, warm the earth and contribute to climate
                    change. By using green energy, we ensure the best outcome for both ourselves, the natural environment,
                    and all other life on earth.

                <h2>What can I do to promote green energy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Fossil fuels are backed by powerful, established interests of billions, sometimes trillions, of dollars.
                    While renewable energy interests are emerging, they are not nearly as well engrained in the political
                    system. Therefore, as individuals, it is important that we make an impact by contacting our representatives and voting
                    for pro-green energy candidates.
